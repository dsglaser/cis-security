# Task file for CIS Controls
# This file is commented to help view what Ansible Automation is doing
#  and under what circumstances.

# Some blocks below have tasks with tags and some without. Blocks of tasks that
#  contain multiple controls have tasks with tags. Blocks that consist of a
#  single control and are just put together for convience sake, do not have
#  sub-block tasks with tags.

# Comments about how the modules are used will become more infrequent as
#  the file goes along to avoid repeating oneself.

  # Let the user know what version of the controls file is running
  # Use a variable so it prints out the correct version.
